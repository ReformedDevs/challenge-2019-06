PONY - Reformed Devs Code Golf 2019.06
======================================

6502, because otherwise it would have been My Little Pony facfic

Bare virtual metal, no libraries.

Counted size is for the machine code, because of the 1:1 correspondance of
opcodes between the assembly file and the machine code file. If I were Woz,
I would have hand entered program into a binary file directly, like in the
good old days.

Made possible by
 - `6502.org`_ the 6502 microprocessor resource
 - cbA65 65xx assembler `http://crbond.com/tools.htm <http://crbond.com/tools.htm>`_
 - Py65 65xx emulator* `https://github.com/mnaberez/py65 <https://github.com/mnaberez/py65>`_
 
* Modified specifically to enable the actual 6502 code to run for the challenge
