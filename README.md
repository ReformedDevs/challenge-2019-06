# The Reformed Devs Monthly Challenge

## June 2019

### Background

The Reformed Devs on Slack began doing monthly code challenges a couple of months ago. We decided to begin hosting the challenges in the official TRD namespace for June 2019. You can see the previous challenges below:

* [April 2019](https://github.com/plusuncold/longest-word-test)
* [May 2019](https://github.com/plusuncold/rainfall-calc-challenge)

### The Challenge

#### Problem

Users will submit code to solve this problem, blatantly stolen from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=20).
What is the sum of the digits of the result of `100!`, where `n!`  represents `n x (n - 1) ... x 3 x 2 x 1`.

Example: `5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120`. The sum of the digits of `120` is `1 + 2 + 0`, which is `3`. Therefore the solution is `3`.

#### Output

Use a .sh file to output your username, the results, and your solution's byte size.
Ex: ``echo "specs, `python run.py`, `wc -c < run.py`"``

#### Scoring

This will be a golf challenge, so users will be scored based on the length of their solution in bytes.
